Today I want to share the 5 writing tips that completely transformed my writing process and helped me finish "[BOOK_TITLE]".

1. Write First, Edit Later
   Don't let perfectionism stop your momentum. Get the words down first.

2. Set Micro-Goals
   Instead of "write a book," try "write 500 words today."

3. Create a Writing Ritual
   Same time, same place, same coffee. Your brain loves routine.

4. Read in Your Genre
   The best writing teachers are the books you love.

5. Trust the Process
   Every first draft is supposed to be messy. That's normal!

Which of these resonates with you? I'd love to hear about your writing journey.
